Must Do's:
 - Create user guide with a FAQ
 - Add player promotion history on player details
 - Add a blacklist option for hiding servers in the server browser.
 - Add more global player statistics
 --> Kits used Statistics Pie Chart
 --> Weapon used Statistics Pie Chart
 --> Vehicle used Statistics Pie Chart
 --> Vehicle vs Weapon Pie Chart
 --> Wins by Army Pie Chart
 --> Expansion / Mod played pie chart
 --> Top played maps
 --> Average SPM

Nice To Have's:
 - Create a system where a round played with too many BattleSpy flags will not be saved, but rather have to be
    sanctioned after review by the stats admin before being processed into the database.

FAQ
 - I lose my rank at the end of each round
    A: At the end of each round, the game server sends the round data to the ASP. When the game server loads the next
        round, it fetches each users stats data again from the ASP. If the ASP has not finished processing the previous
        rounds data for any reason, then the data loaded by the game server will be of the players previous status.
    How can I fix this?: Increase the time between rounds to allow the ASP more time to finish processing the round data.
