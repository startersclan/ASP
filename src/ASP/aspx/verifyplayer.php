/**
 * The purpose of this ASPX call is to prevent players from using any kind of
 * Cross Service Exploitation. An example of this is being logged into a Gamespy
 * service provider A, and playing on a server that uses Service B's Stats system.
 *
 * Servers using our service will use this page to verify the following:
 *
 *  1. The player exists in our stats database (by PID)
 *  2. The player's name matches the name we have in the database.
 *  3. The player is not flagged as banned in our stats database
 *  4. The player is logged on using our gamespy servers.
 *
 * This page will output either "OK" or "NOK" under the "result" header.
 * If a server receives a "NOK" result, and submits a snapshot with said player in it,
 * the snapshot will be rejected during processing. The new 3.0 python contains the
 * compiled python scripts to properly use this service.
 *
 * Whether a server uses this service or not, is on the administrator. However,
 * the snapshot processor will deny processing any snapshots that detect any kind
 * of Cross Service Exploitation, which in turn will make the server "Unranked".
